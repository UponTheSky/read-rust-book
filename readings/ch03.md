# Common Programming Concepts

## Variables and Mutability
- in Rust, by default, variables are immutable
  - good for safety, easy concurrency
  - why does Rust encourages you to have immutability?

- not determining whether a variable is immutable or not could cause possible bugs
- but when mutability comes into play, we designate a variable as `mut`
